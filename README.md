This is a personal software project from around 1994/1995. This was intended to allow "voting" on a school file-based network system at the time. Basically, create a poll and let students log in and place their vote.

There is a set of libraries used that I am unsure if I can post due to totally unknown licensing. I absolutely paid for them so I could use them personally and in my compiled projects, but I cannot include them here alongside my code

As you can see, the header in each file is ... unhelpful

Here's some screens of vote! Running for the first time in about 25 years. Running in [dosbox](https://www.dosbox.com/) because I STILL HAD OLD COMPILED BINARIES!
