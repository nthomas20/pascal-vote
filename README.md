This is a personal software project from around 1994/1995. This was intended to allow "voting" on a school file-based network system at the time. Basically, create a poll and let students log in and place their vote.

There is a set of libraries used that I am unsure if I can post due to totally unknown licensing. I absolutely paid for them so I could use them personally and in my compiled projects, but I cannot include them here alongside my code

As you can see, the header in each file is ... unhelpful
